A [Paperclip](https://paperclip.ing) adapter that lets you run [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) as a managed employee in a Paperclip company.

Hermes Agent is a full-featured AI agent by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com) with 30+ native tools, persistent memory, session persistence, 80+ skills, MCP support, and multi-provider model access.

## Currently in flight (0.8.x)

The active workstream in this fork is **hardening the MCP tool plane**
shipped in 0.7.0. Hermes agents at MarketIntelLabs used to drive
Paperclip by executing `curl` commands the prompt template spelled out
for them — reliable-ish for reads, error-prone for writes, impossible to
scope, and impossible to audit. 0.7.0 moved all Paperclip interactions
onto a structured stdio MCP server (`paperclip-mcp`). 0.8.x closes the
observability, trust, and reliability gaps that surfaced once real
agents were running on v3:

**0.8.0-mil.0 (April 2026) — hardening:**

- **`update_issue_status` MCP tool** with scope enforcement — the LLM can
  transition an issue to `done`/`blocked`/`cancelled` through a
  structured call instead of a `RESULT:` marker, while the adapter
  still enforces `PAPERCLIP_ISSUE_ID` as the write boundary.
- **Per-call NDJSON audit log** written by the MCP server to
  `$HERMES_HOME/mcp-tool-calls.ndjson` (one `tool_call_start` /
  `tool_call_end` record per invocation), collected by `execute.ts` into
  `resultJson.toolCalls`, `toolCallCount`, `toolErrorCount`. First
  trustworthy record of what the LLM *actually* invoked (separate from
  whatever prose it wrote in its final response).
- **Curl-bypass detector** — post-run scan of stdout/stderr for
  `curl ... localhost:3100` and `/api/issues/...` shell invocations;
  flags the run with `errorCode: tool_bypass_attempt` so LLMs that
  ignore the "use tools, not curl" rule can't slip by unnoticed.
- **MCP subprocess liveness file + death detection** — the server
  writes its PID at startup and removes it on clean exit; the adapter
  detects stale PIDs post-run and flips `errorCode: tool_server_died`
  with the last-known call count. No more silent tool-plane failures.
- **`builtin:mil-heartbeat-v3` prompt update** — prefers the new
  `update_issue_status` tool over the `RESULT:` marker (marker retained
  as a structured fallback).

**0.8.1-mil.0 — env propagation fix (superseded by 0.8.3 note below):**
first attempt at restoring tool-call telemetry by setting
`PAPERCLIP_MCP_AUDIT_LOG` and `PAPERCLIP_MCP_LIVENESS_FILE` on the
adapter's own `env` block. That doesn't actually reach the MCP
subprocess — Hermes' `_build_safe_env` strips parent env down to a
small allowlist (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TERM`,
`SHELL`, `TMPDIR`, `XDG_*`) before merging `mcp_servers.<name>.env`.
The write is a no-op; 0.8.3 removes it and leans solely on the
config.yaml path (which `hermes-home.ts` has always populated).

**0.8.3-mil.0 — resume guard + config diagnostic:** two small defenses
on top of 0.8.2. (1) Before passing `--resume <id>` to `hermes chat`
we now re-run `isPlausibleSessionId` on the stored `sessionParams.sessionId`
via a new `resolveResumeSessionId` helper. If some other store (a
Hermes SQLite state file, a paperclip cache we missed during the
MAR-30 cleanup) still holds a poisoned value, we log the rejection and
let the run create a fresh session instead of inheriting a crash loop.
(2) After writing the per-run `config.yaml`, the adapter reads it
back and logs `audit=<bool> liveness=<bool>` so a single line of
`stdout_excerpt` now tells you whether the telemetry env block made
it into the file on disk — the only way we have to tell config.yaml
issues from Hermes-side env filtering issues without ECS Exec. The
belt-and-suspenders process-env write from 0.8.1 is removed (it never
worked — see the 0.8.1 note above).

**0.8.4-mil.0 — adapter version in resultJson:** every run now records
`resultJson.adapterVersion` (pulled from the new canonical
`src/shared/version.ts`) so dashboards, the runbook, and incident
forensics can tell at a glance which adapter produced a given run.
Critical during rollouts and hot-patches where the deployed adapter
version is the first thing you need to know and `stderr_excerpt` is
often truncated past the startup banner. The MCP server banner
(`[paperclip-mcp] server paperclip@<version> connected …`) now reads
from the same source.

**0.8.2-mil.0 — session-id poisoning fix:** when Hermes crashes because
`--resume <id>` names an unknown session it prints
`"Use a session ID from a previous CLI run"`. The legacy non-quiet
session-id regex matched the phrase `"session ID from"` and captured
the literal word `"from"` as a session id; Paperclip persisted it as
`session_id_after` and the next heartbeat re-ran `--resume from`,
crashing in exactly the same way. Fix is three layers of defense:
anchor the legacy regex to `session_id:` / `session saved:` with a
mandatory colon, reject captured tokens that don't look like real
session ids (`isPlausibleSessionId` — min length, must contain a
digit/hyphen/underscore), and skip session-id extraction entirely when
`"Session not found"` appears in the output. Regression pinned by nine
new tests in `parse-hermes-output.test.ts` (driven by the MAR-30
heartbeat crash loop on 2026-04-19).

Rollout is gated per-agent by `adapterConfig.promptTemplate`: flip one
agent to `builtin:mil-heartbeat-v3` at a time, flip back to v2 to roll
back. The 0.8.x hardening only kicks in on v3 runs. See the
[fork divergence list](./UPSTREAM.md#divergence-from-upstream)
(items 8–13) for the implementation sketch.

## MIL-specific features

Features you get in this fork that upstream doesn't ship:

- **Adapter-owned status transitions** (`builtin:mil-heartbeat-v2+`) —
  the adapter PATCHes the issue to `in_progress` before spawning Hermes
  and transitions it to the terminal status the LLM signalled via a
  `RESULT:` marker, instead of trusting the LLM to run the status
  `PATCH` itself. See [`src/server/result-marker.ts`](./src/server/result-marker.ts).
- **MCP tool server** (`builtin:mil-heartbeat-v3`, 0.7.0+) — see
  [Currently in flight](#currently-in-flight-08x) above.
- **Per-run `HERMES_HOME`** (0.7.0+) — race-free per-run configuration
  for the MCP server. See [`src/server/hermes-home.ts`](./src/server/hermes-home.ts).
- **MCP tool audit + bypass + death detection** (0.8.0+) — every run
  that used the MCP tool plane gets a trustworthy record of which
  tools were invoked (`resultJson.toolCalls`), a flag when the LLM
  tried to bypass it with `curl` (`errorCode: tool_bypass_attempt`),
  and a flag when the stdio subprocess died mid-run
  (`errorCode: tool_server_died`). See `src/server/mcp-telemetry.ts`,
  `src/server/bypass-detector.ts`.
- **`update_issue_status` MCP tool** (0.8.0+) — structured status
  transitions enforced by `PAPERCLIP_ISSUE_ID` scope. Replaces the
  `RESULT:` marker as the preferred signal; marker stays as a
  fallback.
- **Session-id poisoning guard** (0.8.2+) — the legacy session-id
  regex is anchored and validated so Hermes' own error prose can't be
  mis-captured as a session id (MAR-30 heartbeat crash-loop regression).
- **OpenRouter model-prefix hints** — `anthropic/`, `openai/`, `x-ai/`,
  `zai-org/` model IDs route to `provider: openrouter` automatically.
- **Two MIL heartbeat prompt templates** shipped in the package
  (`templates/mil-heartbeat{,-v2,-v3}.md`) selectable via
  `promptTemplate: "builtin:<name>"`.
- **Benign-stderr classifier** (0.4.1+) — stderr only flips
  `errorMessage` on strong failure signatures, not substring matches.
- **Run-context resolution** (0.4.2+) — per-run fields resolved from
  `ctx.context` (the modern Paperclip shape) with `ctx.config` fallback.
- **Runtime hot-patch deploy path** — MarketIntelLabs' infra ships a
  `scripts/upgrade-adapter.sh` that overlays a new adapter tarball onto
  running ECS tasks without a Docker rebuild, cutting deploy time from
  20-40 min to ~3 min. Requires the companion `ops-entrypoint.sh` hook
  shipped in the [`marketintellabs`](https://github.com/marketintellabs/marketintellabs) infra repo.
- **Release workflow** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes to
  npm on every `v*` tag push.

## Key upstream features (unchanged)

- **8 inference providers** — Anthropic, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Nous, OpenAI Codex, ZAI, Kimi Coding, MiniMax
- **Skills integration** — Scans both Paperclip-managed and Hermes-native skills (`~/.hermes/skills/`), with sync/list/resolve APIs
- **Structured transcript parsing** — Raw Hermes stdout is parsed into typed `TranscriptEntry` objects so Paperclip renders proper tool cards with status icons and expand/collapse
- **Rich post-processing** — Converts Hermes ASCII banners, setext headings, and `+--+` table borders into clean GFM markdown
- **Comment-driven wakes** — Agents wake to respond to issue comments, not just task assignments
- **Auto model detection** — Reads `~/.hermes/config.yaml` to pre-populate the UI with the user's configured model
- **Session codec** — Structured validation and migration of session state across heartbeats
- **Session source tagging** — Sessions are tagged as `tool` source so they don't clutter the user's interactive history
- **Filesystem checkpoints** — Optional `--checkpoints` for rollback safety
- **Thinking effort control** — Passes `--reasoning-effort` for thinking/reasoning models

## Installation

```bash
npm install @marketintellabs/hermes-paperclip-adapter
```

The package also ships a `paperclip-mcp` bin for the MCP tool server,
which the adapter launches automatically when a run resolves to
`builtin:mil-heartbeat-v3`. You shouldn't need to invoke it directly.

### Prerequisites

- [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) installed (`pip install hermes-agent`)
- Python 3.10+
- **Node 24+** (the MCP tool server uses Node 24-compatible APIs; see `engines` in `package.json`)
- At least one LLM API key (Anthropic, OpenRouter, or OpenAI)

## Quick Start

### 1. Register the adapter in your Paperclip server

Add to your Paperclip server's adapter registry (`server/src/adapters/registry.ts`):

```typescript
import * as hermesLocal from "@marketintellabs/hermes-paperclip-adapter";
import {
  execute,
  testEnvironment,
  detectModel,
  listSkills,
  syncSkills,
  sessionCodec,
} from "@marketintellabs/hermes-paperclip-adapter/server";

registry.set("hermes_local", {
  ...hermesLocal,
  execute,
  testEnvironment,
  detectModel,
  listSkills,
  syncSkills,
  sessionCodec,
});
```

### 2. Create a Hermes agent in Paperclip

In the Paperclip UI or via API, create an agent with adapter type `hermes_local`:

```json
{
  "name": "Hermes Engineer",
  "adapterType": "hermes_local",
  "adapterConfig": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "promptTemplate": "builtin:mil-heartbeat-v3",
    "timeoutSec": 300,
    "persistSession": true,
    "enabledToolsets": ["terminal", "file", "web"]
  }
}
```

The `promptTemplate` values you can pick from:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `builtin:mil-heartbeat` | Legacy. LLM drives status transitions via curl. Kept for back-compat. |
| `builtin:mil-heartbeat-v2` | Adapter-owned status. LLM signals outcome via a `RESULT:` marker; adapter PATCHes status. Still uses curl for Paperclip reads/writes. |
| `builtin:mil-heartbeat-v3` | MCP tool server. All Paperclip interactions go through structured tools; curl-in-prompt removed. Adapter-owned status inherited from v2. |
| `(omitted)` | Upstream default template. |
| `<any other string>` | Treated as a literal template with `{{var}}` substitution. |

### 3. Assign work

Create issues in Paperclip and assign them to your Hermes agent. On each heartbeat, Hermes will:

1. Receive the task instructions
2. Use its full tool suite to complete the work
3. Report results back to Paperclip
4. Persist session state for continuity

```

The adapter spawns Hermes Agent's CLI in single-query mode (`-q`). Hermes
processes the task using its full tool suite, then exits. The adapter:

1. **Captures** stdout/stderr and parses token usage, session IDs, and cost
2. **Parses** raw output into structured `TranscriptEntry` objects (tool cards with status icons)
3. **Post-processes** Hermes ASCII formatting (banners, setext headings, table borders) into clean GFM markdown
4. **Reclassifies** benign stderr (MCP init, structured logs) so they don't show as errors
5. **Tags** sessions as `tool` source to keep them separate from interactive usage
6. **Reports** results back to Paperclip with cost, usage, and session state

Session persistence works via Hermes's `--resume` flag — each run picks
up where the last one left off, maintaining conversation context,
memories, and tool state across heartbeats. The `sessionCodec` validates
and migrates session state between runs.

### Skills Integration

The adapter scans two skill sources and merges them:

- **Paperclip-managed skills** — bundled with the adapter, togglable from the UI
- **Hermes-native skills** — from `~/.hermes/skills/`, read-only, always loaded

The `listSkills` / `syncSkills` APIs expose a unified snapshot so the
Paperclip UI can display both managed and native skills in one view.

### MCP Tool Server (v3 agents)

For agents on `builtin:mil-heartbeat-v3`, the adapter additionally:

1. Builds a per-run `HERMES_HOME` at `/tmp/paperclip-run-<runId>-XXXXXX/`.
2. Symlinks `sessions/`, `skills/`, `.env`, and other entries from the
   real `~/.hermes/` into it (so session resume + skills keep working).
3. Writes a fresh `config.yaml` into the per-run dir that contains the
   base config plus an `mcp_servers.paperclip` block whose `env` block
   carries *this run's* `PAPERCLIP_API_KEY` (JWT), `PAPERCLIP_AGENT_ID`,
   `PAPERCLIP_COMPANY_ID`, and — critically — `PAPERCLIP_ISSUE_ID`
   (the scope boundary for writes).
4. Spawns Hermes with `HERMES_HOME` pointing at the per-run dir.
5. Teardown (`rm -rf`) runs in `finally`, so the temp dir is cleaned up
   even on timeout or crash.

Hermes spawns the `paperclip-mcp` subprocess over stdio. All tool calls
go through that subprocess with a server-side `MAX_TOOL_CALLS=20` cap,
structured per-call logging (`[paperclip-mcp-log]`), and scope
enforcement. 0.8.0+ additionally writes two sidecar files inside the
per-run `HERMES_HOME`:

- `mcp-tool-calls.ndjson` — one `tool_call_start` / `tool_call_end`
  JSON record per invocation. `execute.ts` reads this after the run
  and fills `resultJson.toolCalls` / `toolCallCount` / `toolErrorCount`.
- `mcp-server.pid` — written at startup, removed on clean exit.
  `execute.ts` checks it post-run to detect a crashed tool plane
  (`errorCode: tool_server_died`).

Both files' paths are passed to the subprocess via
`PAPERCLIP_MCP_AUDIT_LOG` / `PAPERCLIP_MCP_LIVENESS_FILE` env vars set
directly on the Hermes process (Hermes does not forward the per-server
`env` block in `config.yaml` to stdio subprocesses — 0.8.1 fix).
